👋Welcome! 

<p align="justify">
I am a computational physicist with over 7 years of experience in machine learning, data analysis, and computational modeling. I have a strong background in coding and developing AI/ML pipelines, leveraging technologies like Python, C++, SQL, and AWS SageMaker to build robust, scalable models. My expertise includes deploying machine learning models across various platforms and industries, solving real-world problems in finance, biotech, and data engineering.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In addition to my research, I provide technical consultation to startups and established companies, offering tailored solutions in AI, bias mitigation, and predictive modeling. I work closely with teams to design and implement effective, ethical AI systems that drive impactful, data-driven decision-making.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I am also actively exploring the latest advancements in prompt engineering, LLM integration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using open-source tools like Hugging Face to enhance the capabilities of large language models and other AI systems.
